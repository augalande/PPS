# PreAssignment1-Question2
print('''My hobby includes playing Badminton. Badminton is a the only sport which makes me feel active and healthy
while having fun. Playing this sport makes me feel strong and confident. The game is simple and easy to play. It is
played by 2 or 4 players and requires racquets and a shuttlecock. The players have to serve the shuttlecock, and the
other side has to hit it back and not let it touch the floor. If the shuttlecock hits the floor, the other side
receives a point. They also get to serve. The match is divided into sets of two. If both teams win one set each then
the third set is played. The first team or player to reach 21 points becomes the winner of the set. I play badminton
with my friends and family on a court near our house as a means to relax and take a break from studies. Playing the
game acts as a stress buster for me. I love the game so much that I make sure to take some time out for it from by
daily busy schedule.''')
